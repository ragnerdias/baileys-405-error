# ✅ Fixing 405 Error & Upgrading Baileys Connection – Step-by-Step Guide

Many developers using [Baileys](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys) for WhatsApp automation recently faced issues like:

```
Connection closed: Method Not Allowed (405)
```

This usually means your client is using an **outdated protocol or API method**. Here's how to **fix this by updating Baileys and improving your connection setup**.

---

## 🧩 Why This Happens

WhatsApp Web updates frequently. Older versions of Baileys may use **deprecated WebSocket methods**, triggering 405 errors. You must update your library and connection logic.

---

## 🛠️ Step 1: Update Baileys

Run this command in your backend project:

```bash
npm install @whiskeysockets/baileys@latest
```

---

## 🔐 Step 2: Ensure Global Crypto Polyfill (for Node.js 16 or lower)

In your `wbot.ts` or `startBot.ts`:

```ts
if (!(global as any).crypto) {
  (global as any).crypto = require("crypto").webcrypto;
}
```

This fixes missing `crypto.subtle` errors in older Node environments.

---

## ⚙️ Step 3: Initialize the Socket Safely

Use the latest `makeWASocket` with `authState`, caching and proper version detection:

```ts
import makeWASocket, {
  Browsers,
  fetchLatestBaileysVersion,
  makeCacheableSignalKeyStore,
  isJidBroadcast
} from "@whiskeysockets/baileys";

const { version } = await fetchLatestBaileysVersion();

const sock = makeWASocket({
  logger,
  version,
  browser: Browsers.appropriate("Desktop"),
  auth: {
    creds: state.creds,
    keys: makeCacheableSignalKeyStore(state.keys, logger)
  },
  msgRetryCounterCache,
  shouldIgnoreJid: jid => isJidBroadcast(jid)
});
```

---

## 📡 Step 4: Handle Connection Events

Make sure you're handling disconnects and reconnects properly:

```ts
sock.ev.on("connection.update", async ({ connection, lastDisconnect }) => {
  if (connection === "close") {
    const statusCode = (lastDisconnect?.error as Boom)?.output?.statusCode;
    if (statusCode === 403) {
      // Session expired or banned
    } else if (statusCode !== DisconnectReason.loggedOut) {
      // Attempt reconnect
    }
  }

  if (connection === "open") {
    // Mark as connected in DB or emit status
  }

  if (qr !== undefined) {
    // Handle QR Code generation
  }
});
```

---

## 🔌 Step 5: Review Socket.IO Server (for React dashboard)

If you’re using `socket.io`, ensure your `cors` is set correctly:

```ts
io = new SocketIO(httpServer, {
  cors: {
    origin: process.env.FRONTEND_URL
  }
});
```

And confirm you're not blocking WebSocket upgrades in any proxy (like NGINX).

---

## ✅ Bonus Tips

- Use `fetchLatestBaileysVersion()` to stay compatible with WhatsApp Web.
- Always clear old sessions if errors persist (`.wwebjs_auth`, or `authState` files).
- Use a retry mechanism with `StartWhatsAppSession()` if you detect unexpected disconnections.

---

## 💬 Example Full Setup

The author of this guide runs this structure in production with:

- React frontend
- Baileys backend (Node.js + Express + Redis + PostgreSQL)
- Multi-tenant WhatsApp sessions
- `socket.io` for real-time events

If you're still getting `405` after the update, **check your proxy or hosting** – it may be rejecting the connection method Baileys needs (`CONNECT`, `UPGRADE`, or WebSocket headers).
